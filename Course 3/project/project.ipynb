      "2023 Fashion Trend: Sheer Clothing. \"Bare it all\" has been the motto since the end of the lockdown. In 2023,  naked dressing makes its way from the red carpet – where celebrities like Cher and Rihanna have been sporting the trend forever – to street style. From a cellophane-like dress, worn over a boldly hued maxi skirt at Tory Burch's spring 2023 show, to a frothy frock revealing undergarments at Victoria Beckham, the previously risqué trend is coming not only for your weekend wardrobe but even workwear.\n",

Bonus points: It pairs well with Pantone's Viva Magenta.\n",
